## Health Club or Gym System

This project is a simple Java GUI application based on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, designed for managing a Health Club or Gym system.

    d) Admin can make reports about members.
    e) Admin assigns members to their coaches.

- **Coach Module**
    a) Coach can put a plan and timeline schedule for his members.
    b) Coach can send messages to all his members.

- **Member Module**
    a) Member can see the end date of the subscription.
    b) Member can see his Coach and his Schedule.
    c) The system must send a notification when the member's subscription ends.
